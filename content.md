Proviq — Pro • Vision • IQ
Building Adaptive AI Systems for the Real World

Proviq is a systems-first AI company focused on building long-vision intelligent platforms that don’t just automate tasks — they learn, adapt, and improve inside real operational environments.

We design and deploy adaptive AI systems that evolve with your data, your users, and your infrastructure. Our work spans Agentic AI, Reinforcement Learning, Generative AI, Computer Vision, IoT intelligence, and production-grade software systems.

Proviq serves as a host intelligence organization, developing and operating multiple specialized platforms that together form a modern intelligence stack — designed to grow as technologies and paradigms shift.

At its core, Proviq stands for proactive intelligence: AI systems with vision, memory, feedback, intent, and the ability to adapt continuously.

What Proviq Does
From Static AI to Living Intelligence Systems

Most AI deployments today are static — trained once, deployed once, and slowly degraded by reality.

Proviq helps organizations move beyond that.

We design learning environments where AI systems:

Observe real-world signals across software, devices, users, and operations

Decide actions with traceable policies and operational constraints

Learn from delayed, sparse, and imperfect feedback

Adapt decisions, policies, and workflows over time

All while staying aligned with operational constraints, safety, and governance

The result is AI that improves with use, not systems that require constant retraining or replacement.

Across domains, Proviq-powered systems have enabled:

Up to 25× productivity gains in AI development and deployment workflows

Up to 75% cost optimization by eliminating brittle pipelines and manual iteration

Production-ready deployments in hours instead of months

How We Deliver Intelligence
Modular. Composable. Infrastructure-Friendly.

Proviq delivers intelligence through modular platforms and services that integrate directly into existing infrastructure.

Our delivery principles are simple:

No rip-and-replace — AI adapts to your systems

Environment-aware learning — intelligence is shaped by real conditions

Feedback-driven loops — every action improves future decisions

Traceable and auditable intelligence — decisions you can inspect and govern

Scalable by design — from pilots to enterprise scale

We combine reinforcement learning, agentic systems, generative models, computer vision, IoT integration, and MLOps to deploy AI that survives real operational complexity.

Our Platforms
OptRL — From Rewards to Reality

OptRL is Proviq’s real-time reinforcement learning and decision optimization platform, built for environments where:

Actions have delayed or uncertain outcomes

Optimal behavior cannot be hard-coded

Feedback is sparse, noisy, or indirect

Conditions evolve continuously

OptRL enables systems to:

Learn optimal policies from real operational feedback

Optimize decisions under constraints and uncertainty

Adapt continuously as environments change

Maintain full decision traces for analysis, safety, and control

Impact
OptRL transforms workflows, recommendation engines, and operational pipelines into self-improving decision systems — bringing reinforcement learning out of research and into production, where rewards reflect reality rather than assumptions.

Computer Vision Platform — Perception That Feeds Decisions

Proviq provides a production-ready computer vision layer that turns raw video into structured, actionable signals.

This layer enables organizations to:

Convert camera feeds into intelligent perception systems

Detect, classify, and track real-world events in real time

Deploy AI using no-code and low-code workflows

Operate across edge, on-prem, and cloud environments

Continuously improve accuracy through real-world feedback

Visual intelligence is not treated as a standalone feature.
It acts as a perception layer that feeds:

Agentic workflows

Reinforcement learning environments

Alerting and monitoring systems

Analytics and automation pipelines

Outcome
Video data move from passive observation to active operational intelligence, enabling safety, monitoring, automation, compliance, and adaptive decision-making — without disrupting existing infrastructure.

Services
Agentic AI Systems

Design and deployment of autonomous and semi-autonomous agents that plan, act, observe outcomes, and adapt over time.

Generative AI Integrations

Production-grade integration of generative models into workflows, grounded in domain context and system feedback.

Reinforcement Learning & Environment Design

Custom RL environments that allow existing systems to learn optimal behavior under real operational constraints.

Computer Vision

End-to-end perception systems for real-time detection, alerts, analytics, and learning.

IoT & Edge Intelligence

Embedding intelligence directly into physical and cyber-physical systems for local adaptation and control.

MLOps & AI Infrastructure

Reliable pipelines for training, deployment, monitoring, versioning, and governance.

Recommendation & Decision Engines

Adaptive systems optimized for long-term outcomes, not short-term metrics.

Knowledge Graphs & Intelligent Retrieval

Graph-based systems connecting data, context, and meaning for explainable reasoning and retrieval.

Why Proviq

Proviq is not a single-product AI company.

It is an intelligence architecture company — designed to host, integrate, and evolve multiple AI paradigms as the landscape changes.

By combining:

Decision intelligence (OptRL)

Computer vision

Agentic and generative systems

Reinforcement learning and feedback loops

Production-grade software engineering

Proviq builds systems that:

Observe. Decide. Learn. Adapt.

All while operating inside the reality of your infrastructure.

Proviq builds AI with vision — and the IQ to sustain it.
