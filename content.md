## Proviq — Pro • Vision • IQ

**Proviq** is a systems-first AI company focused on building **long-vision intelligent platforms** that don’t just automate tasks, but **learn, adapt, and improve inside real environments**.
We design and deploy AI systems that evolve with your data, your users, and your operational reality.

Proviq acts as the **host organization** for multiple specialized initiatives, each addressing a critical layer of modern intelligence infrastructure. Today, this includes **OptRL** and **TuskerAI**, with more platforms to follow.

At its core, Proviq stands for **proactive intelligence** — AI systems with vision, memory, feedback, and intent.

## What We Do

We help organizations move from **static AI integrations** to **living, learning systems**.

Instead of treating AI as a one-time deployment, we design environments where models:

* Observe real-world outcomes
* Learn from user and system feedback
* Adapt policies, decisions, and representations over time
* Remain aligned with operational constraints

Our work spans agentic systems, real-time learning, visual intelligence, and decision optimization — all grounded in production-ready engineering.

## How We Deliver

Proviq delivers intelligence through **modular, composable platforms** that integrate directly into your existing infrastructure.

Our delivery philosophy:

* **No rip-and-replace** — AI adapts to your systems, not the other way around
* **Feedback-driven learning loops** — every action improves future decisions
* **Traceable and controllable intelligence** — decisions are observable, auditable, and tunable
* **Scalable by design** — from pilot environments to enterprise scale

We combine reinforcement learning, generative AI, computer vision, and systems engineering to deploy AI that survives real operational complexity.

## Our Platforms

### OptRL — *From Rewards to Reality*

**OptRL** is Proviq’s real-time learning and decision optimization platform.
It focuses on environments where actions matter, outcomes unfold over time, and optimal decisions cannot be hard-coded.

OptRL enables systems to:

* Learn from delayed and sparse feedback
* Optimize policies under real-world constraints
* Adapt continuously as environments change
* Maintain decision traces for analysis and control

**Impact:**
OptRL transforms workflows, recommendation systems, and operational pipelines into **self-improving decision engines**. It brings reinforcement learning out of research and into production — where rewards reflect reality, not assumptions.

### TuskerAI — *Enable Visual Intelligence in Your Existing Infrastructure*

**TuskerAI** is Proviq’s no-code and low-code **computer vision intelligence platform** designed for rapid deployment at scale.

TuskerAI allows organizations to:

* Turn cameras and video streams into intelligent sensors
* Detect, track, and reason about visual events in real time
* Integrate visual insights into existing systems without ML expertise
* Continuously improve vision models through feedback and usage

**Impact:**
TuskerAI converts raw visual data into **actionable intelligence** — powering video vigilance, monitoring, safety, analytics, and automation without disrupting current infrastructure.

## Services

### Agentic Workflows

Design and deployment of autonomous and semi-autonomous agents that plan, act, observe outcomes, and adapt over time within structured environments.

### MLOps

Production-grade pipelines for training, deploying, monitoring, and evolving machine learning models with reliability, versioning, and governance.

### Video Vigilance Systems

End-to-end intelligent video systems built on TuskerAI, enabling real-time detection, alerts, and situational awareness.

### Generative AI Integrations
